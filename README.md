# Phase-1-Code-Challenge-Flatacuties-080421
This is an app for voting for the cutest animal.

This project is a test of our understanding of the three pillars of Web Programming:
- Recognizing events
- Manipulating the DOM
- Communicating with the server.


The following deliverables were met:
1.All character names were rendered in the `div` with an id of `"character-bar"`
2. Using fetch() method to make a request to the desired endpoint `'http://localhost:3000/characters'`
3. Using an event listener to display character details on click
4. Checking the total votes cast for a given flatacutie.
